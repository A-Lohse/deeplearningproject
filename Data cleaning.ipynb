       "'<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Indian Needs Assessment and Program Evaluation Act of 2001\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS, PURPOSES. Findings. Congress finds that the United States and the Indian tribes have a unique legal and political government-to-government relationship. Pursuant to the Constitution, treaties, statutes, Executive orders, court decisions, and course of conduct, the United States has a trust obligation to provide certain services to Indian tribes and to Indians. Federal departments and agencies charged with administering programs and providing services to, or for the benefit of, Indians have not furnished Congress with adequate information necessary to assess such programs on the needs of Indians and Indian tribes. Such lack of information has hampered the ability of Congress to determine the nature, type, and magnitude of such needs as well as its ability to respond to them. And Congress cannot properly fulfill its obligation to Indian tribes and Indian people unless and until it has an adequate store of information related to the needs of Indians nationwide. Purposes. The purposes of this Act are to ensure that Indian needs for Federal programs and services are known in a more certain and predictable fashion. Require that Federal departments and agencies carefully review and monitor the effectiveness of the programs and services provided to Indians. Provide for more efficient and effective cooperation and coordination of, and accountability from, the Federal departments and agencies providing programs and services, including technical and business development assistance, to Indians. And provide Congress with reliable information regarding Indian needs and the evaluation of Federal programs and services provided to Indians nationwide. <SECTION-HEADER> INDIAN TRIBAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT. Indian Tribal Needs Assessments. Immediate assessment. In general. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall contract with an appropriate entity, in consultation and coordination with the Indian tribes, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Attorney General, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the heads of any other relevant Federal departments or agencies, for the development of a uniform method and criteria, and uniform procedures for determining, analyzing, and compiling the program and service assistance needs of Indian tribes and Indians by each such department or agency. The needs assessment shall address, but not be limited to, the following: The location of the service area of each program. The size of the service area of each program. The total population of each tribe located in the service area. The total population of members of other tribes located in the service area. The availability of similar programs within the geographical area to tribes or tribal members. The socio-economic conditions that exist within the service area. Consultation. The contractor shall consult with tribal governments in establishing and conducting the needs assessment required under subparagraph (A). Ongoing federal needs assessments. In general. Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and every 5 years thereafter, each Federal department or agency, in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior, shall conduct an Indian Needs Assessment aimed at determining the actual needs of Indian tribes and Indians eligible for programs and services administered by such department or agency. Submission to congress. Not later than February 1 of any year in which an INA is required to be conducted under subparagraph (A), a copy of the INA shall be submitted to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate. Federal Agency Indian Tribal Program Evaluation. In general. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall develop a uniform method and criteria, and uniform procedures for compiling, maintaining, keeping current, and reporting to Congress all information concerning the annual expenditures of the department or agency for programs and services for which Indians are eligible, with specific information regarding the names of tribes who are currently participating in or receiving each service, the names of tribes who have applied for and not received programs or services, and the names of tribes whose services or programs have been terminated within the last fiscal year. Services or programs specifically for the benefit of Indians, with specific information regarding the names of tribes who are currently participating in or receiving each service, the names of tribes who have applied for and not received programs or services, and the names of tribes whose services or programs have been terminated within the last fiscal year. And the department or agency method of delivery of such services and funding, including a detailed explanation of the outreach efforts of each agency or department to Indian tribes. Submission to Congress. Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, each Federal department or agency responsible for providing services or programs to, or for the benefit of, Indian tribes or Indians shall file an Annual Indian Program Evaluation with the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate. Annual Listing of Tribal Eligible Programs. Not later than February 1 of each calendar year, each Federal department or agency described in subsection (b)(2), shall develop and publish in the Federal Register a list of all programs and services offered by such department or agency for which Indian tribes or their members are or may be eligible, and shall provide a brief explanation of the program or service. Confidentiality. Any information received, collected, or gathered from Indian tribes concerning program function, operations, or need in order to conduct an INA or an AIPE shall be used only for the purposes of this Act set forth in section 2(b). <SECTION-HEADER> REPORT TO CONGRESS. In General. Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall develop and submit to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate a report detailing the coordination of Federal program and service assistance for which Indian tribes and their members are eligible. Strategic Plan. Not later than 30 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation and coordination with the Indian tribes, shall file a Strategic Plan for the Coordination of Federal Assistance for Indians .
